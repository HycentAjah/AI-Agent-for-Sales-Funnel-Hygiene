# AI-Agent-for-Sales-Funnel-Hygiene

### Business Problem
Sales and revenue operations teams often face challenges related to poor CRM data hygiene,
including incomplete lead records, duplicate contacts, inconsistent formatting, stale deals, and
inaccurate forecasting. These issues lead to lower sales rep productivity, reduced pipeline visibility,
and unreliable analytics. The current manual data-cleaning methods are inefficient, error-prone, and
non-scalable. This project proposes building an autonomous multi-agent system that continuously
monitors, detects, and remediates CRM data issues in real time across the sales funnel.

### Project Description: Multi-Agent Data Hygiene System for Sales Funnel

Agents focused on a specific task would work in cohesion to maintain healthy sales funnel data by
continuously scans sales funnel data to detect inaccuracies.
1. Missing Fields Agent – Detects records lacking required fields like email, lead source, or close
date.
2. Validation Agent – Ensures data format and value correctness (e.g., email syntax, numeric deal
sizes).
3. Deduplication Agent – Finds and merges duplicate leads, contacts, or accounts using fuzzy logic.
4. Staleness Agent – Identifies inactive leads or opportunities based on the last activity.
5. Normalization Agent – Standardizes data formats (e.g., name casing, phone numbers).
6. Enrichment Agent – Pulls missing information from external APIs (e.g., company size, job title).
7. Insights Agent – Generates dashboards and hygiene metrics for management oversight.
8. Alert Agent – Sends real-time notifications or assigns cleanup tasks to CRM owners.
9. Orchestrator Agent – Coordinates workflow and inter-agent communication.

Each of the nine agents performs one type of check or cleanup action. For example, one agent looks
for missing fields, another agent standardizes formatting, and another sends alerts or reminders to
sales reps to fix their records. All the agents communicate through a central controller (called the
Orchestrator Agent), ensuring tasks happen correctly (e.g., validate →, enrich →, normalize).
